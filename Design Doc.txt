Objective:
The object of the game is to crack a safe in the allotted time by listening to the click of the dials.

Difficulty:
There are three levels of difficult: easy, medium, hard, that add more time and dials to the safe.

Player Skill:
There are four levels of player skill: basic, adept, skilled, master, that distort the click sound when the dial is orientated correctly.

Controls:
The player can click and drag on each individual dial to rotate them and click on the button in the middle to try to open the safe.
This project uses the new Unity Input System.
